# Design Guidelines

## Concept Phase

### Theme
The website should give an impression of a journey, travel and adventure. There should also be a balance in design between playfull and serious-buisness.

### Hierarchy and layout
TODO: Ask the question about this thing to teacher person
Primary focus of the page is the call to action/ rent now button. The reason for this is that we want the users to easily navigate to choosing their car and renting.

### Images
Images sourced from finn and pixabay
All images used in the application are located in the ./assets file

For the landing page we will have text on the image, since the image will act as a background

For the rest of the website the text will always be next to the images.

We will mostly use clear images to show the cars as best as possible. We may use slight tint on some of the images.

### Icons
Icons will be used for navigation and informational seconds to create an understanding of what is being displayed.

For the icon pack we will use google material icons. The icons will be gray scale.

### Typography
Sans-serif cause it is clean, simple, modern and is easy to read. 

Headers:
- Bold
- 32px+

Body:
- thin
- 16-32px

The font will have rounded corners.


### Border rounding
Borders will be slightly rounded to give a playfull design.

Borders should be 1 rem

### Shadows
Shadows will be used to emphasize important elements.
