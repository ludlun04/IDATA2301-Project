# Design Guidelines

## Concept Phase

### Theme
The aim of the website is to give an impression of journey, travel and adventure. There is also a balance in design between playfull and serious-buisness.


### Color Theme
- Companies primary color is #FFCA1E. This color gives a feeling of happiness, liveliness, hope, curiosity and intelligence. 
- Accent colors and alternative colors will be chosen from the palette below.

N.B. The ratioes between text and background are checked to ensure readability.

### Hierarchy and layout
Our base layout consists of a header at the top, page content at the center and footer at the bottom. 
- Header contains our logo and navigation
- Page content contains the main content of the page
- Footer contains information, links and contact information

When loading the page the user is presented with a lander page. The primary focus of the page is the call to action/ rent 
now button. The reason for this is that we want the users to easily navigate to choosing their car and renting.

The main and most important content will always be located towards the center, with navigation and extra elements around it.
This ensures the user should be naturally guided towards seeing the most important content first.

### Images
Images sourced from finn and pixabay
Images used only by the frontend is located in the assets folder. The images related to the cars are stored in the database.

For the landing page we have text on the image, since the image will act as a background. For the rest of the website the text will always be next to the images.

We use clear images to show the cars as best as possible.

### Icons
Icons are used for navigation and informational seconds to create an understanding of what is being displayed.

For the icon pack we use google material icons. The icons are either grayscale or altered to adhere to our primary color scheme.

### Typography
We decided to use Sans-serif because it is clean, simple, modern and is easy to read. The font we chose is Kantumruy Pro.
This font is clean and simple with a modern look. It is also easy to read and has a good balance between playfull and serious.

Headers:
- Bold
- 32px+

Body:
- thin
- 16-32px


### Border rounding
Borders are slightly rounded to give a slightly playfull design. We decided on all borders being rounded to 1rem
which ensures that the design is consistent across the website.

### Shadows
Shadows are used to emphasize important elements or elements that should stand out from the background.
